# isometric_map

This project is an interactive 3D isometric web map of College Station, built using Three.js and open source GIS data.
This project sits at the intersection of GIS, cartography, and web-based 3D visualization. It is intended as:
- a prototype for urban visualization,
- a reference for converting GIS data into Three.js scenes,
- and a foundation for further spatial analysis or interactive storytelling.
